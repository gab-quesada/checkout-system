## Checkout System

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this back-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to implement a checkout system for a local farmer's market.

We sell the following four products at the local farmerâ€™s market every week.

```
+--------------|--------------|---------+
| Product Code |     Name     |  Price  |
+--------------|--------------|---------+
|     CH1      |   Chai       |  $3.11  |
|     AP1      |   Apples     |  $6.00  |
|     CF1      |   Coffee     | $11.23  |
|     MK1      |   Milk       |  $4.75  |
+--------------|--------------|---------+
```

This week, weâ€™re celebrating our one year anniversary and would like to offer the following specials. To do so, weâ€™ll need to update our checkout system to apply the following rules.

BOGO -- Buy-One-Get-One-Free Special on Coffee. (Unlimited)
APPL -- If you buy 3 or more bags of Apples, the price drops to $4.50.
CHMK -- Purchase a box of Chai and get milk free. (Limit 1)

Your users should be able to:

- Scan items
- At any time, we should be able to print out the current register to see what the state of the basket is.
- Checkout the basket to see the final price, this should include the price and the applied discount or special.

Using Ruby, implement a checkout system that allows us to fulfill the above requirements.

## Runnning the project 

To test the project I created a few TDD test in rspec

You simply have to clone the project. Then to install the dependencies run 
- `bundle install`

Then run rspec and see the tests pass

- `rspec`
